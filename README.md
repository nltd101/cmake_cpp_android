# 📱 Android Native C++ Integration Example

This project demonstrates how to build an **Android application** that integrates with **C++ native code** using the **Java Native Interface (JNI)**. It’s ideal for performance-critical operations or reusing existing native libraries in Android apps.

---

## ✨ Features

* Android app built with **Java**
* Native functionality implemented in **C++**
* Communication between Java and C++ via **JNI**
* Built using **Android Studio** with **CMake**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies

* **Java** – Android framework and UI
* **C++** – Native logic implementation
* **JNI** – Bridge between Java and C++
* **Android Studio** – Project IDE
* **CMake** – Native build system

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Add Native Library Files

Place your native files in the following directory:

```
android-project/app/src/main/cpp/testadd/
```

Include:

* `.so` library file
* Corresponding header (`.h`) file

### 2. Configure CMake

Update your `CMakeLists.txt` located at:

```
android-project/app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt
```

Ensure it properly includes and links your `.so` library and headers.

### 3. Call Native Code

Use `native-lib.cpp` to call your JNI-exposed functions. File location:

```
android-project/app/src/main/cpp/native-lib.cpp
```

You can define your native methods here and link them with your Java classes.

```

## 📘 Notes

* Make sure your `.so` file matches the target architecture (e.g., `armeabi-v7a`, `arm64-v8a`, etc.).
* Rebuild the project after modifying native code or CMake configuration.
